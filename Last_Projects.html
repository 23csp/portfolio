                <h4> Description: </h4> For this project, Amina (my partner) and I collaborated on an interactive story which uses user feedback. We brainstormed many different projects but finally agreed upon our game called A Day In Your Life. We incorporated many different options and scenarios based on the users input. Our end project was a success and was funny, imaginative and interesting. Our feedback backs up this idea and was almost all positive.
                Our team dynamic was very effective ; we communicated easily and were able to compromise without undermining the other personâ€™s ideas.

                  <h4> Description: </h4> For this project,we were essentially given a basic idea and asked to branch out from there. I used various variables in scratch and learned a lot of valuable ideas about the basics of coding. On top of this, I also used several different sources to create my own character for this game. While this project impacted me (for the better) tremendously, there still were many obstacles. Since I was a beginner, it was difficult to understand some topics and grasp some ideas. Once I continously asked questions and worked harder,though, I was able to comprehend and learn more and more. This project served as a gateway to what I am sure will be hundreds more projects with coding. (If you want to play, press space to shoot out pokeballs)
